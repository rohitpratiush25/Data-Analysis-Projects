Hi, Everyone 
Iâ€™ve uploaded an exciting project on GitHub that features exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a variety of datasets, including smartphone usage, COVID-19 trends, digital marketing insights, and FIFA statistics. 
Using Jupyter Notebook, I analyzed each dataset to uncover meaningful patterns, generate insightful visualizations, and provide actionable findings. 
The project demonstrates my ability to work with diverse data, clean and preprocess it, and draw valuable conclusions through advanced EDA techniques. 
Whether you're interested in pandemic trends, marketing performance, or sports analytics, this project offers something for everyone. 
Visit my GitHub profile to explore the project and discover these insightful analyses!
